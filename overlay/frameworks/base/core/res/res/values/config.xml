           remote submix module.  This module is used to record and stream system
           audio output to the WiFi display encoder in the media server.
         * The remote submix module "audio.r_submix.default" must be installed on the device.

         This mode provides best compatibility for devices using legacy power management
         features such as early suspend / late resume.

         When true, setInteractive(...) will be called independently of whether the display
